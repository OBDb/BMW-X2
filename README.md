## About BMW X2

The BMW X2 is a subcompact luxury crossover SUV that combines coupe-like styling with practical SUV characteristics. It sits alongside the X1 in BMW's lineup but features a more dynamic and sporty design approach.

## Generations

- **First Generation (F39: 2018-2023)**: The original X2 was introduced as a sportier alternative to the X1, featuring a distinctive coupe-like roofline and BMW's signature kidney grille. It shared its UKL2 platform with the X1 and MINI Countryman. Engine options included both diesel and petrol variants, with the range-topping M35i model producing 302 hp. Front-wheel drive came standard on lower trims, while BMW's xDrive all-wheel-drive system was available on higher trims.

- **Second Generation (U10: 2024-present)**: The second-generation X2 underwent a significant transformation, growing in size and adopting a more pronounced coupe-SUV design. It transitioned to BMW's FAAR platform, offering both internal combustion and all-electric (iX2) variants. The new generation features a larger kidney grille, slim LED headlights, and a more sophisticated interior with BMW's curved display. Engine options range from efficient four-cylinders to the performance-oriented M35i, now producing 312 hp.
